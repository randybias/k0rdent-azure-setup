# Completed Backlog Items

This file contains backlog items that have been completed and moved from the main BACKLOG.md.

## Add Missing External Dependencies to Prerequisites Check
**Completed**: 2025-07-14
**Priority**: Was HIGH

### Summary
Updated the centralized prerequisites check (`bin/check-prerequisites.sh`) to include all external dependencies that were previously checked within individual scripts.

### External Dependencies Added
1. **kubectl** - Changed from optional to required (used extensively in k0rdent deployment)
2. **helm** - Changed from optional to required (critical for k0rdent installation)
3. **git** - Added as required (used for commit operations in deploy-k0rdent.sh)
4. **Common utilities** - Added comprehensive check for:
   - `timeout` - Used in VM creation scripts for background process management
   - `mktemp` - Used for creating temporary files
   - `stat` - Used for file information (different syntax on macOS/Linux)
   - `ping` - Used for connectivity testing
   - `ifconfig` (macOS) / `ip` (Linux) - Platform-specific network tools

### Changes Made
- Updated `bin/check-prerequisites.sh` to include all missing dependencies
- Changed kubectl and helm from optional to required status
- Added new check functions for git and common utilities
- Updated README.md to document all 14 required prerequisites
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing scripts

### Impact
- All external tool dependencies are now checked centrally before deployment
- Individual scripts no longer need to check for external tools
- Clear error messages and installation instructions for missing tools
- Improved deployment reliability by catching missing dependencies early

## KOF (k0rdent Operations Framework) Implementation
**Completed**: 2025-07-14
**Priority**: Was HIGH

### Summary
Successfully implemented the core KOF installation system with the following components:

1. **KOF Mothership Installation** (`bin/install-kof-mothership.sh`)
   - Fully implemented with Istio service mesh installation
   - KOF operators deployment working
   - State tracking integrated
   - Uninstall functionality tested

2. **KOF Regional Cluster Deployment** (`bin/install-kof-regional.sh`)
   - Creates new k0rdent-managed Azure cluster
   - Applies KOF ClusterProfiles automatically
   - Kubeconfig retrieval automated
   - Monitoring and observability configured

3. **Azure Child Cluster Capability** (`bin/setup-azure-cluster-deployment.sh`)
   - Azure credentials configuration complete
   - ClusterDeployment CRDs working
   - Resource templates configured
   - Integration with k0rdent cluster management

4. **Child Cluster Integration** (`bin/create-child.sh`)
   - `--with-kof` flag implemented
   - Automatic ClusterProfile application for KOF-enabled children
   - Proper labeling for Istio integration

5. **Supporting Infrastructure**
   - Azure Disk CSI Driver installation (`bin/install-k0s-azure-csi.sh`)
   - KOF configuration in YAML files
   - State management integration
   - Common KOF functions library (`etc/kof-functions.sh`)

### Key Achievements
- Installing KOF mothership on the management cluster
- Deploying a separate KOF regional cluster via k0rdent
- Creating child clusters with KOF functionality as an option
- Proper state tracking throughout the deployment lifecycle
- Clean uninstall/rollback capabilities
- Maximum reuse of existing k0rdent infrastructure
- Modular, script-based approach
- Optional component model (KOF remains opt-in)
- Istio-based deployment for cloud agnosticity

## Azure Disk CSI Driver Integration
**Completed**: 2025-07-14
**Priority**: Was HIGH

### Summary
Successfully implemented Azure Disk CSI Driver integration as a prerequisite for KOF deployment. This provides persistent storage capabilities for k0rdent clusters running on Azure.

### Implementation Details
1. **Script Created**: `bin/install-k0s-azure-csi.sh`
   - Installs Azure Disk CSI Driver on k0s clusters
   - Creates default storage class (StandardSSD_LRS)
   - Integrates with deployment flow
   - State tracking for CSI installation

2. **Key Features**:
   - Automatic installation when `--with-kof` flag is used
   - Namespace creation and RBAC setup
   - Driver and controller deployment
   - Storage class configuration
   - Verification of driver pod readiness

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Enables persistent storage for stateful applications
   - Required for KOF components (Grafana, VictoriaMetrics)
   - Default storage class for PVC provisioning
   - Seamless integration with existing deployment

## Other Completed Items from Previous Sessions

### Bug Fixes

#### Bug 4: Missing reset capability in create-azure-vms.sh
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Resolved 2025-06-18
**Priority**: ~~Medium~~ **COMPLETED**

**Description**: The script `bin/create-azure-vms.sh` did not have a reset argument and capability, unlike other scripts in the project that support `reset` functionality for cleanup.

**Fix Applied**: Added `reset` command to create-azure-vms.sh with:
- Single API call using `az vm list --output yaml` parsed with yq
- Parallel VM deletion with `--no-wait` option
- Optional wait for deletion completion (skippable with `--no-wait`)
- State tracking for deleted VMs

#### Bug 6: SSH keys not being cleaned up on reset
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Resolved in recent commits
**Priority**: ~~Medium~~ **COMPLETED**

**Description**: SSH keys were not being cleaned up from the local filesystem when running reset operations.
**Fix Applied**: SSH key cleanup implemented in setup-azure-network.sh reset function

#### Bug 8: VM creation failures not handled with automatic recovery
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Resolved 2025-06-18
**Priority**: ~~High~~ **COMPLETED**

**Description**: VM creation failures (both provisioning failures and cloud-init errors) were not automatically recovered, causing deployment to stall or continue with missing VMs.

**Fix Applied**: Implemented "cattle not pets" methodology in create-azure-vms.sh:

**VM Provisioning Failure Recovery**:
- Detects VMs with `state == "Failed"` during the wait loop
- Automatically deletes failed VMs with `az vm delete --no-wait`
- Immediately recreates VM with same configuration
- Tracks retry attempts (max 2 retries per VM)
- Continues with deployment once VM is healthy

**Cloud-init Failure Recovery**:
- Added `check_cloud_init_error()` function to detect `status: error`
- Triggers VM replacement when cloud-init errors are detected
- Resets SSH verification status for recreated VMs
- Tracks separate retry count for cloud-init failures (max 1 retry)

#### Bug 10: VM verification loop inefficiently rechecks already verified VMs
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Resolved 2025-06-18
**Priority**: ~~Low~~ **COMPLETED**

**Description**: The VM monitoring loop in create-azure-vms.sh continued to recheck VMs that had already been verified as operational while waiting for other VMs to reach Succeeded state.

**Fix Applied**: Added VM verification tracking system to create-azure-vms.sh:
- **VM_VERIFIED array**: Tracks VMs that have passed both SSH connectivity and cloud-init validation
- **Skip verification checks**: VMs marked as verified are skipped in subsequent monitoring loops
- **Reset on recreation**: Verification status is reset when VMs are deleted and recreated due to failures
- **Maintains retry logic**: Failed VMs continue to be monitored and recreated as needed

### Minor Enhancements

#### Configuration Validation System
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented in previous sessions
**Priority**: ~~High~~ **COMPLETED**

**Description**: Pre-deployment configuration validation system

**Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ **Azure VM SKU availability validation**: Validates VM sizes are available in specified regions and zones
- ✅ **Azure zone support validation**: Verifies availability zones are supported in target region
- ✅ **Network configuration validation**: CIDR overlap detection and subnet validation
- ✅ **Zone configuration validation**: Ensures zones exist in target region
- ✅ **Interactive validation feedback**: Provides helpful error messages with suggested fixes
- ✅ **Integration with deployment flow**: Runs validation before Azure resources are created
- ✅ **Skip validation option**: `--skip-validation` flag for offline/faster operations

#### ARM-based Configuration Examples  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Examples created
**Priority**: ~~Low~~ **COMPLETED**

**Description**: Create ARM-optimized versions of existing configuration examples

**Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ `config/examples/production-arm64-southeastasia.yaml` - ARM64 production setup with Standard_D4pls_v6/D16pls_v6 VM sizes
- ✅ `config/examples/production-arm64-southeastasia-spot.yaml` - ARM64 production with Spot instances
- ✅ ARM64 Debian image support: `debian-12:12-arm64:latest`
- ✅ ARM-optimized VM sizing configurations
