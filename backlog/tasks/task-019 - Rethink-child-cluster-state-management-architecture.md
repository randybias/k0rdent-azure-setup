## Description

Current local cluster state tracking duplicates information that k0rdent already manages, creating potential inconsistencies and maintenance overhead. The architecture should be redesigned with k0rdent as the single source of truth for cluster state while local files only track operational events and history.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] k0rdent is the single source of truth for cluster state
- [ ] Local files only track operational events and history
- [ ] Scripts query kubectl for live cluster status
- [ ] State synchronization complexity eliminated
- [ ] Event-driven local tracking implemented
