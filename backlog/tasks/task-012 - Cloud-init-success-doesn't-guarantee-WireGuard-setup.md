## Description

VMs can pass cloud-init status verification but still fail WireGuard configuration verification, indicating cloud-init completion doesn't guarantee all services are properly configured. Cloud-init may report success before WireGuard service fully initializes or WireGuard systemd service may not be properly enabled/started.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cloud-init status accurately reflects WireGuard service readiness
- [ ] WireGuard interface is properly configured when cloud-init reports success
- [ ] VM verification includes WireGuard-specific validation
- [ ] Deployment reliably establishes WireGuard connectivity on all VMs
