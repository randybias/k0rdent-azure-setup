## Description

Create a plan to create an asynchronous script that runs during deployments, monitors deployment events and sends a desktop notification for new events.  It should start at the beginning of deployments after the events file is created.  It should require a new command line argument: --with-desktop-notifications.

Two different options to send notifications include:

- hammerspoon
- osascript

But other options should be investigated.

## Implementation Plan

1. Research macOS notification methods (osascript, hammerspoon, terminal-notifier)
2. Design event monitoring approach (file watching vs polling)
3. Define notification format and content structure
4. Plan integration with deploy-k0rdent.sh script
5. Design background process management
6. Create notification filtering/configuration options
7. Plan testing approach for async notifications
8. Document usage and requirements
