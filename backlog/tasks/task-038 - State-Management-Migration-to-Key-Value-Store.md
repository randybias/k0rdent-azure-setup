## Description

Migrate from file-based state management to a proper key-value store for better scalability, performance, and multi-instance support.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] KV store options evaluated
- [ ] Migration approach designed
- [ ] Backward compatibility ensured
- [ ] Implementation plan documented

## Current State Management Limitations

- **File-based storage**: State stored in local YAML files under `state/` directory
- **Single instance**: No support for concurrent operations or shared state
- **Performance**: Multiple file I/O operations for state updates
- **Backup complexity**: Manual backup to `old_deployments/` directory
- **No locking**: Potential race conditions with concurrent script execution
- **Local only**: State not available across different systems

## Proposed Key-Value Store Options

1. **Redis** - Fast, lightweight, with persistence options
2. **etcd** - Kubernetes-native, strong consistency, watch capabilities
3. **Consul** - Service discovery integration, strong consistency
4. **Local SQLite** - Simple embedded database with SQL capabilities

## Technical Considerations

- **Backward compatibility**: Support reading existing YAML state files during migration
- **Connection management**: Handle KV store unavailability gracefully
- **State structure**: Maintain hierarchical key structure (deployment.phase, kof.mothership_installed, etc.)
- **Atomic operations**: Ensure state consistency during updates
- **Watch/notification**: Real-time state change notifications for monitoring

## Implementation Approach

- **Phase 1**: Abstract state management behind interface layer
- **Phase 2**: Implement KV store backend with YAML fallback
- **Phase 3**: Migration utilities for existing deployments
- **Phase 4**: Deprecate file-based storage

## Benefits

- **Shared state**: Multiple instances can share deployment state
- **Performance**: Faster state access and updates
- **Atomic operations**: Guaranteed state consistency
- **Real-time monitoring**: Watch for state changes
- **Distributed deployments**: Support for remote state management
- **Better concurrency**: Handle multiple operations safely

## Use Cases

- **Multi-cluster management**: Centralized state for multiple k0rdent deployments
- **Team workflows**: Shared state across team members
- **CI/CD integration**: Pipeline access to deployment state
- **Monitoring dashboards**: Real-time deployment status
- **Disaster recovery**: Persistent state backup and restoration

## Configuration Integration

- Add KV store configuration to existing YAML config files
- Support multiple backend types with automatic fallback
- Maintain existing API compatibility for scripts

## Example Configuration

```yaml
state_management:
  backend: "redis"  # redis, etcd, consul, file
  redis:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 6379
    database: 0
    password: ""
  fallback: "file"  # Always fall back to file-based storage
```

## Migration Path

- Existing deployments continue using file-based storage
- New deployments can opt-in to KV store backend
- Migration tool to move existing state to KV store
- Gradual deprecation of file-based storage

## Dependencies

- Requires KV store infrastructure setup
- Network connectivity for remote KV stores
- Backup strategy for KV store data
- Monitoring for KV store health

**Priority Justification**: Future enhancement that becomes important as the system scales to multiple clusters, teams, or automated deployments. Not critical for current single-cluster workflows but valuable for operational maturity.
