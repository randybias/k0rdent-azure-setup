## Description

Cache Azure zone/region state data locally to reduce API calls and speed up deployment process. Multiple Azure API calls during deployment for data that rarely changes like VM size availability validation region capability checks and zone availability verification.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Local caching system implemented with timestamped data
- [ ] Cache includes VM size availability per region/zone
- [ ] Automatic cache refresh based on time expiration
- [ ] Cache validation and force refresh options available
- [ ] Fallback to live API calls if cache is stale/missing
