## Description

The entire deployment process needs to be idempotent with clear logging about when files are regenerated versus reused, ensuring transparent and predictable behavior during partial deployments. Re-running partial deployments regenerates files that already exist with unclear logging about whether files are being reused or regenerated.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All deployment scripts check for existing files before regenerating
- [ ] Clear logging distinguishes between reusing existing files vs creating new ones
- [ ] State tracking includes generated file information
- [ ] --force-regenerate flag available for specific operations
- [ ] Safe to re-run deployments at any stage without unwanted side effects

## Technical Details

### Current Issues
- Re-running partial deployments regenerates files that already exist
- Unclear logging about whether files are being reused or regenerated
- Lack of transparency about what actions are being taken vs skipped
- State management doesn't clearly track what has been generated
- Users unsure if re-running is safe or will overwrite configurations

### Required Improvements
1. **File Generation Tracking**:
   - Check if files exist before regenerating
   - Log clearly when reusing existing files vs creating new ones
   - Track file generation timestamps in state
   - Provide options to force regeneration when needed

2. **Clear Logging Standards**:
   - "==> Using existing file: [filename]" for reused files
   - "==> Generating new file: [filename]" for new creation
   - "==> Regenerating file: [filename] (forced)" for forced updates
   - "==> Skipping: [action] (already completed)" for idempotent operations

3. **State-Aware Operations**:
   - Track which files have been generated in deployment state
   - Skip regeneration unless explicitly requested or files missing
   - Provide --force-regenerate flag for specific operations
   - Validate existing files before reuse

4. **Idempotent Script Updates**:
   - All generation scripts check for existing files
   - Clear decision logic for regeneration vs reuse
   - Consistent behavior across all deployment scripts
   - State tracking for all generated artifacts

### Implementation Areas
- `bin/prepare-deployment.sh` - File generation logic
- `bin/create-azure-vms.sh` - Cloud-init generation
- `bin/install-k0s.sh` - Configuration file generation
- `etc/state-management.sh` - Track generated files
- All scripts that create files or configurations

### Benefits
- Safe to re-run deployments at any stage
- Clear understanding of what's happening
- Prevents accidental configuration overwrites
- Easier debugging of partial deployments
- Better user confidence in the system
