## Description

When a deployment is interrupted and restarted, the deployment script doesn't properly handle the existing state. Instead of intelligently resuming from where it left off, it attempts to re-run deployment steps, making poor decisions based on incomplete state analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] State-aware resumption logic implemented
- [ ] Infrastructure validation before operations
- [ ] VPN state checking before SSH attempts
- [ ] State reconciliation between recorded and actual state
- [ ] Graceful continuation from interruption point
- [ ] Validation gates between deployment phases
