# Deployment State Tracking Implementation Plan

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Priority**: High (Performance & UX Impact)  

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive YAML-based deployment state tracking system that consolidates Azure resource management, WireGuard configuration, and deployment status into a single, authoritative state file. This eliminates redundant Azure API calls and provides real-time deployment visibility.

---

## Current State Management Issues

### Scattered State Information
- **Azure resources**: CSV manifest in `./azure-resources/azure-resource-manifest.csv`
- **WireGuard keys**: CSV manifest in `./wireguard/wg-key-manifest.csv`  
- **VM public IPs**: Fetched repeatedly via API calls
- **Deployment progress**: No persistent tracking
- **Component status**: Checked via live API calls

### Performance Problems
- **45+ redundant Azure API calls** during single deployment
- **3+ duplicate IP address lookups** per VM
- **Continuous polling** every 30 seconds during VM creation
- **Cross-script data re-fetching** with no caching
- **Slow status displays** due to live API queries

### User Experience Issues
- **No deployment progress visibility** between script runs
- **Cannot resume** interrupted deployments gracefully
- **Status checks are slow** due to live API queries
- **No historical record** of deployment events

---

## Proposed Solution: Unified Deployment State

### Single Source of Truth
Replace multiple CSV files and live API queries with a single `deployment-state.yaml` file that:

- **Tracks all deployment components** in structured format
- **Caches Azure resource data** to minimize API calls
- **Records deployment progress** and timestamps
- **Enables fast status queries** without Azure API calls
- **Supports deployment resume** after interruptions
- **Maintains audit trail** of deployment events

---

## YAML Schema Design

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core State Management (Week 1)

#### Milestone 1.1: State File Infrastructure
**Goal**: Basic YAML state file creation and management

**New Functions** (`etc/state-management.sh`):
```bash
# Initialize deployment state from configuration
init_deployment_state() {
    local deployment_id="$1"
    # Create initial YAML from user/internal config
    # Set deployment_phase="preparation"
    # Record configuration snapshot
}

# Update specific section of state
update_deployment_state() {
    local section="$1"  # e.g., "azure_resources.virtual_machines.k0s-controller"
    local key="$2"      # e.g., "status"
    local value="$3"    # e.g., "running"
    # Use yq to update YAML file atomically
}

# Get value from state
get_deployment_state() {
    local path="$1"  # e.g., "azure_resources.virtual_machines.k0s-controller.public_ip"
    # Use yq to query YAML file
}

# Add event to audit trail
add_deployment_event() {
    local phase="$1"
    local action="$2" 
    local message="$3"
    local resource="${4:-}"
    # Append to events array with timestamp
}
```

**Modified Scripts**:
- `bin/prepare-deployment.sh`: Initialize state file, migrate from CSV manifests
- `etc/common-functions.sh`: Add state management utilities

#### Milestone 1.2: Azure Resource State Integration
**Goal**: Replace Azure API polling with state-based caching

**New Functions**:
```bash
# Refresh VM data from Azure and update state
refresh_vm_state() {
    local vm_names=("$@")
    # Single Azure API call to get all VM data
    # Update state file with fresh data
    # Set last_checked timestamps
}

# Get VM data from state (with optional refresh)
get_vm_info() {
    local vm_name="$1"
    local force_refresh="${2:-false}"
    local max_age_minutes="${3:-5}"
    
    # Check if data is stale
    if [[ "$force_refresh" == "true" ]] || vm_data_is_stale "$vm_name" "$max_age_minutes"; then
        refresh_vm_state "$vm_name"
    fi
    
    # Return cached data from state file
}
```

**Modified Scripts**:
- `bin/create-azure-vms.sh`: Use state-based VM queries
- `bin/manage-vpn.sh`: Get VM IPs from state instead of API

#### Milestone 1.3: WireGuard State Integration
**Goal**: Consolidate WireGuard manifest into deployment state

**Implementation**:
- Migrate `wireguard/wg-key-manifest.csv` data into YAML
- Update key generation to write to state file
- Modify VPN scripts to read from state
- **Replace file-based status tracking**: Convert `.vpn-setup-complete` file to `wireguard.laptop_config.setup_complete` boolean flag in state
- **Consolidate directory structure**: All WireGuard files now in single `wireguard/` directory (laptop config no longer in separate directory)

### Phase 2: Enhanced State Operations (Week 2)

#### Milestone 2.1: Smart State Synchronization
**Goal**: Intelligent state refresh based on deployment phase

**Strategy**:
```bash
# Context-aware state refresh
sync_deployment_state() {
    local current_phase=$(get_deployment_state "metadata.deployment_phase")
    
    case "$current_phase" in
        "vm_creation")
            # Actively refresh VM provisioning states
            refresh_vm_state "${VM_HOSTS[@]}"
            ;;
        "cluster_setup")
            # VM states less likely to change, refresh less frequently
            refresh_vm_state_if_stale "${VM_HOSTS[@]}" 15  # 15 minute cache
            ;;
        "complete")
            # Deployment complete, minimal refreshing needed
            ;;
    esac
}
```

#### Milestone 2.2: Deployment Resume Capability
**Goal**: Resume interrupted deployments using state file

**New Commands**:
```bash
./deploy-k0rdent.sh resume   # Resume from last known state
./deploy-k0rdent.sh status   # Show current deployment status
```

**Implementation**:
- Detect interrupted deployments from state file
- Resume from appropriate phase based on component states
- Skip completed components, continue with pending ones

#### Milestone 2.3: Enhanced Status Reporting
**Goal**: Rich status displays using cached state data

**Features**:
- Instant status display (no Azure API calls needed)
- Deployment progress visualization
- Historical event timeline
- Component health overview

### Phase 3: Advanced State Features (Week 3)

#### Milestone 3.1: State Validation & Recovery
**Goal**: Ensure state file accuracy matches Azure reality

**Features**:
```bash
# Validate state against Azure reality
validate_deployment_state() {
    # Compare state file with live Azure resources
    # Report discrepancies
    # Offer to sync state with reality
}

# Recover from state corruption
recover_deployment_state() {
    # Rebuild state file from Azure resources
    # Preserve deployment history where possible
    # Handle partial deployments gracefully
}
```

#### Milestone 3.2: Deployment Rollback Support
**Goal**: Support deployment rollback using state history

**Features**:
- State file versioning/snapshots
- Rollback to previous deployment state
- Component-level rollback capabilities

---

## Integration Points

### Script Modification Strategy

#### `bin/prepare-deployment.sh`
**Before**: Generate separate CSV manifests  
**After**: Initialize comprehensive deployment state YAML

```bash
# Replace CSV generation with state initialization
init_deployment_state "$K0RDENT_PREFIX"
update_deployment_state "metadata.deployment_phase" "preparation"
add_deployment_event "preparation" "deployment_started" "Beginning k0rdent deployment"

# Migrate WireGuard key generation to state file
for host in "${!WG_IPS[@]}"; do
    update_deployment_state "wireguard.peers.$host" "{ip: ${WG_IPS[$host]}, private_key: $priv_key, public_key: $pub_key}"
done
```

#### `bin/setup-azure-network.sh`
**Before**: Write to CSV manifest  
**After**: Update deployment state

```bash
# Track resource creation in state
update_deployment_state "azure_resources.resource_group" "{name: $RG, status: created, created_at: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)}"
add_deployment_event "azure_setup" "resource_group_created" "Resource group created" "$RG"

# Replace file-based status tracking with state flags
update_deployment_state "wireguard.laptop_config.setup_complete" "true"  # instead of touch .vpn-setup-complete
```

#### `bin/create-azure-vms.sh`
**Before**: Multiple individual Azure API calls  
**After**: Single API call + state caching

```bash
# Replace individual VM queries
# OLD: 
for HOST in "${VM_HOSTS[@]}"; do
    PUBLIC_IP=$(az vm show --resource-group "$RG" --name "$HOST" --show-details --query "publicIps" -o tsv)
done

# NEW:
refresh_vm_state "${VM_HOSTS[@]}"  # Single API call
for HOST in "${VM_HOSTS[@]}"; do
    PUBLIC_IP=$(get_deployment_state "azure_resources.virtual_machines.$HOST.public_ip")
done
```

#### `bin/manage-vpn.sh`
**Before**: Query VM IPs via Azure API  
**After**: Read from deployment state

```bash
# Replace API calls with state queries
PUBLIC_IP=$(get_deployment_state "azure_resources.virtual_machines.$HOST.public_ip")
WG_PRIVATE_KEY=$(get_deployment_state "wireguard.peers.$HOST.private_key")
```

### Backwards Compatibility

#### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Run in parallel - maintain CSV files alongside YAML state
2. **Phase 2**: Default to YAML state, fall back to CSV if needed
3. **Phase 3**: Remove CSV file generation entirely

#### CSV-to-YAML Migration Tool
```bash
./bin/migrate-state.sh csv-to-yaml   # Convert existing CSV manifests to YAML state
./bin/migrate-state.sh yaml-to-csv   # Export YAML state to CSV (compatibility)
```

## Performance Impact Analysis

### API Call Reduction

#### Current State (Per Deployment):
- **VM Creation Polling**: 80 calls (5 VMs × 16 poll cycles × 1 call each)
- **Status Display Queries**: 15-20 calls (5 calls per VM × multiple status checks)
- **Cross-Script IP Lookups**: 15-20 calls (same IPs fetched by multiple scripts)
- **Multiple Property Queries**: 15-20 calls (separate calls for IP, size, state per VM)
- **Total**: ~125-140 Azure API calls

#### With State Tracking:
- **VM Creation Polling**: 16 calls (1 bulk call × 16 poll cycles)
- **Initial Data Population**: 3-5 calls (bulk queries to populate state)
- **Status Displays**: 0 calls (from cached state)
- **Cross-Script Access**: 0 calls (from state file)
- **Total**: ~20-25 Azure API calls

**Performance Improvement**: **80-85% reduction** in Azure API calls

#### VM Creation Wait Time Reality:
**Important Note**: The actual VM provisioning time (3-8 minutes) cannot be optimized - Azure takes the time it takes. The optimization is in **how efficiently we poll** during that wait period and **eliminating redundant queries** elsewhere in the deployment process.

### User Experience Improvements

#### Deployment Speed
- **VM Status Display**: Instant (vs 5-10 seconds)
- **Cross-Script Data Access**: Instant (vs 2-3 seconds per query)
- **Overall Deployment**: 20-30% faster due to reduced API latency

#### Operational Benefits
- **Resume Capability**: Continue interrupted deployments
- **Rich Status Display**: Detailed progress without performance penalty
- **Audit Trail**: Complete deployment history
- **Offline Status**: Show last known state when Azure unavailable

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Data Consistency Risks

#### Risk: State File Out of Sync with Azure Reality
**Mitigation**:
- Regular state validation commands
- Automatic sync checks during critical operations
- Recovery tools to rebuild state from Azure resources
- Clear timestamps showing data freshness

#### Risk: State File Corruption
**Mitigation**:
- Atomic YAML updates using temporary files

- Resume capability based on partial state

### Implementation Risks

#### Risk: Complex State Management Logic
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple read/write operations
- Extensive testing with various deployment scenarios
- Clear error handling and recovery procedures
- Comprehensive documentation

#### Risk: Performance Regression During Development
